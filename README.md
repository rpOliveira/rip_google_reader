RIP Google Reader

Give me some juice that you still have there.

Google Reader was created on October, 2005 and has stored since then every entrance of every feed that was added to the platform. All this info was on Google Servers by the time it decided to kill Google Reader. Many sites and blogs and individual posts were erased from the Web but were still available on Google Reader. Therefore, killing Google Reader did not just kill the service but erased a lot of historic content from the Web. I created this script to extract some of that information from all the blogs and sites I have followed since 2005.
